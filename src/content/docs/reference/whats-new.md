## v0.23.0

### Conversation history

You can now browse and restore past conversations. Click the **clock icon** in the sidebar toolbar to see a list of previous sessions, each with an auto-generated title and timestamp. Click any entry to pick up where you left off. [Learn more](/guides/using-the-sidebar/#conversation-history)

### Live activity feed

A new activity feed appears in the sidebar while dassi is working. It shows a rolling, timestamped log of each action — navigating to a site, reading a page, clicking a button, and more — so you always know what's happening. [Learn more](/guides/using-the-sidebar/#activity-feed)

### Switch away while dassi works

When a task takes longer than about 10 seconds, a banner appears offering to let you browse freely while dassi finishes. Click **Switch Away** to jump to another tab. You'll get a desktop notification when the task is complete. [Learn more](/guides/using-the-sidebar/#switch-away-while-dassi-works)

### Automatic tab cleanup

After completing a task, dassi now closes intermediate tabs it opened during research (like search results and reference pages), keeping only the tabs with your final results. [Learn more](/guides/browser-automation/#automatic-tab-cleanup)

### Smarter desktop notifications

Desktop notifications now include the name of your task (shown as the tab group title) so you can tell which task just finished — especially useful when running multiple tasks at once.

### Bug fixes

- Restoring a past conversation no longer causes the original session to disappear from history.
- The "Switch Away" banner no longer appears immediately at the start of subsequent tasks.
- Error and budget-limit screens now properly reset the activity feed.
- Reconnecting after a Chrome restart preserves your active conversation instead of starting a blank session.
